## Java Object-Oriented Client System

This project is a Java-based system designed to model client and account relationships using core object-oriented programming principles.

The application defines a structured class hierarchy that supports both individual and institutional clients, each capable of managing multiple accounts. The system emphasizes clean data modeling, inheritance, composition, encapsulation, and method overriding.

User input is collected via the console to dynamically create clients and assign accounts, with formatted output demonstrating how object relationships are managed and displayed.

### Concepts Demonstrated
- Object-oriented design (inheritance, composition)
- Class hierarchy and reuse
- Data modeling and relationships
- Console-based user input
- Structured output formatting
